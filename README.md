This homework assignment is to create a page using the GiphyAPI.  The intent is to initialize the page with a few buttons to retreive images with.

An input field allows a user to add additional buttons to the page.  These buttons will query the GiphyAPI for images.

Each image shall be a still image, until a user clicks on an image to animate it.  This is set up as a toggle.  

Each image pulls back the rating from GiphyAPI.
